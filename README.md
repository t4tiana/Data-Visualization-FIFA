# Data-Visualization-FIFA
## Using the [FIFA 2023 dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bryanb/fifa-player-stats-database), Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Seaborn, and Bokeh

Once the data was imported as a CSV, I used Pandas in Jupyter Notebook to create a dataframe of the following:

- Player Name
- Overall rating
- Potential rating
- Value_Difference between Overall and Potential

Then used Seaborn and Bokeh to create visualizations of the Value Difference to show **which players may not be achieving their full potential at their current club.**

This could be used by managers who want to understand which players are underachieving and then consider buying them if their contracts are nearly up. If a manager sees one of their own players is included, they would want to focus on unlocking that player's potential.
